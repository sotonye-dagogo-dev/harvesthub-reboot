# Development Checkpoints — Session Log

> **Overview:** Running log of development sessions. Each entry records what was completed, what comes next, and which files were modified. Agents write here at the end of every session so work can be resumed without re-reading the entire codebase.

---

## How to Use

- Agents write an entry after completing each major task.
- Each entry should be resumable — a future agent reading only the latest entry should know exactly where things stand.
- If work is interrupted, record the exact stopping point and any blockers.

## Log Format

```
## Session [number] — [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Goal:**
[What this session is trying to accomplish]

**Completed:**
[What was finished this session]

**Files Modified:**
- [file path] — [what changed]

**Next Task:**
[Exact next step — be specific]

**Notes / Blockers:**
[Anything the next agent needs to know]
```

## Sessions

---

## Session 1 — [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Goal:**
Bootstrap the `.ai-system` docs and capture the current project context.

**Completed:**

- Populated key `.ai-system` docs with MyHarvestHub-specific context.
- Added a project plan, task queue, repo map, and dependency graph.

**Files Modified:**

- `.ai-system/ai-context.md`
- `.ai-system/system-architecture.md`
- `.ai-system/design-system.md`
- `.ai-system/repair-system.md`
- `.ai-system/orchestrator.md`
- `.ai-system/planning/*.md`
- `.ai-system/index/*.md`

**Next Task:**
Run `npm run build` to validate the current build state and capture any TypeScript errors.

**Notes / Blockers:**
None at the moment.

## Session 2 — 2026-03-15

**Goal:**
Validate build and type checks to confirm repository is build-ready for production migrations.

**Completed:**

- Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` locally; build completed successfully and Prisma client was generated.

**Files Modified:**

- None (verification only)

**Next Task:**

- Begin migration of mock backend to Prisma (implement Prisma-backed data adapter in `lib/data/database.ts`).

## Session 3 — 2026-03-15

**Goal:**
Start migrating mock backend to Prisma; add a Prisma adapter for user operations and wire it into the data layer conditionally.

**Completed:**

- Added `lib/data/prismaAdapter.ts` with Prisma-backed `userDb` methods (find/create/update/delete/password helpers).
- Updated `lib/data/database.ts` to conditionally use the Prisma adapter in production or when `USE_PRISMA=true`, while keeping mock adapters for other domains for incremental migration.

**Files Modified:**

- lib/data/prismaAdapter.ts — new file
- lib/data/database.ts — renamed mock exports and added conditional exports
- app/sitemap.ts — added explicit callback types to satisfy type checks
- lib/utils/milestones.ts — added explicit callback types to satisfy type checks

**Next Task:**

- Expand Prisma adapters to other domains (products, banners, orders) and replace mocks incrementally.

**Notes / Blockers:**

- Current change exposes Prisma user adapter; other adapters still use mocks. Plan to implement adapters incrementally and run tests per adapter.

**Notes / Blockers:**

- Build succeeded but some generated Prisma artifacts are large; proceed with careful adapter replacement to avoid regressions.
